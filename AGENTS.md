# Work Method

This document describes the working method used to evolve this repository. It is intended to keep contributions consistent, predictable, and aligned with the project's architecture and conventions.

## 1) Guiding Principles

- **Monorepo first**: everything lives under `apps/` and `packages/`. Root contains only workspace tooling.
- **UI-only in app pages**: app screens and views must not import from `react-native` directly. Use UI primitives from `@lightbridge/ui` instead.
- **All classnames inside UI**: Tailwind classes live only inside UI components via `cva` + `cn`. App pages pass variant props, never raw className strings.
- **Theme tokens only**: never use hardcoded colors in classnames (`bg-[#...]`, `text-[#...]`, `bg-white`, `text-white`, etc.). Use semantic tokens from Tailwind theme (primary/secondary/accent/error/success + ink/soft/subtle/muted/surface/border).
- **No plain visible text**: any user-visible text must come from `i18n` using `t('key')`. Literal strings are allowed only for internal labels, logs, or non-UI constants.
- **Kebab-case filenames**: all new files (TS/TSX/JS/JSON/etc.) must be kebab-case. Only keep conventional exceptions (e.g., `App.tsx`).
- **ASCII only**: avoid non-ASCII characters unless the file already uses them.

## 2) Repository Structure

- `apps/self-service` - Expo app (cross-platform UI)
- `apps/self-service/src/app` - Expo Router routes and layouts (file-based routing)
- `apps/self-service/src/configs` - app-level configs (runtime config, query client, auth config)
- `packages/ui` - UI primitives (RN components with NativeWind, cva, cn)
- `packages/hooks` - service layer hooks (TanStack Query)
- `packages/api-rest` - REST API client package (Hey API codegen target)
- `packages/api-native` - native API wrappers (Linking, Clipboard, etc.)
- `packages/i18n` - centralized i18n config and translations

## 3) Architecture: MVC Layering

### View Layer (App)

- Routes and layouts live in `apps/self-service/src/app` (Expo Router).
- Screens and views live in `apps/self-service/src/screens` and `apps/self-service/src/views`.
- Only composes UI primitives from `@lightbridge/ui`.
- No direct `react-native` imports in route/screen/view components.
- No raw className strings in views/screens.
- No literal user-visible strings; always use `t('...')`.

### Service Layer (Hooks)

- Lives in `packages/hooks`.
- Uses TanStack Query for cache, mutations, and optimistic updates.
- Exposes hooks consumed by screens (e.g., `useApiKeys`, `useTokenUsage`).
- Owns TanStack DB collections and backend sync logic.

### API Layer

- `packages/api-rest`: generated REST client via Hey API (OpenAPI)
- `packages/api-native`: native device/system capabilities, via Expo or RN APIs

### i18n Layer

- `packages/i18n`: i18n initialization and translation resources.
- App uses `I18nProvider` and `useTranslation()` for all visible text.
- `I18nProvider` must initialize i18n before any `useTranslation()` calls (including splash/fallback UI).

## 4) UI Component Design Rules

- Each UI component is a folder with:
  - `cva.tsx` for variants
  - `types.tsx` for props
  - `component.tsx` for implementation
  - `index.tsx` for exports
- Classnames are defined only in `cva.tsx` and combined with `cn` in `component.tsx`.
- Color classnames must use theme tokens (no hardcoded hex/rgb).
- App-level components use **variants**, not className.

## 5) Navigation Rules

- Use Expo Router (file-based routing).
- Routes and layouts live in `apps/self-service/src/app`.
- Tabs live under `apps/self-service/src/app/(tabs)` and use `Tabs` with `ResponsiveTabBar`.
- Auth routes live under `apps/self-service/src/app/(auth)`.
- Use `Stack`, `Tabs`, `router`, `Link`, and `useLocalSearchParams` from `expo-router` in app code.
- Screen titles and tab labels must be translated.

## 6) Naming and File Conventions

- Filenames: kebab-case (e.g., `api-keys-list-view.tsx`).
- Folder names: kebab-case.
- Exports: use named exports; avoid default exports in packages unless required by a framework.
- Entry is `expo-router/entry` via `apps/self-service/index.js` and `apps/self-service/package.json`.

## 7) Dependency Management

- Root `package.json` owns tooling (eslint/prettier/typescript).
- Each workspace package declares its own runtime dependencies.
- Use `workspace:*` for internal package dependencies.
- API client code is generated via `packages/api-rest` (OpenAPI + Hey API).

## 8) Tooling Expectations

- ESLint + Prettier at root.
- Tailwind config per app, with content paths including `packages/ui`.
- Tailwind colors are defined via CSS variable RGB tokens to enable light/dark themes.
- Metro configured to resolve workspace packages.
- i18n configuration centralized in `packages/i18n`.
- Auth persistence: `expo-secure-store` on native, IndexedDB on web.

## 9) Change Checklist

Before finalizing changes:

- [ ] No `react-native` imports in app views/screens.
- [ ] No `className` props in app views/screens.
- [ ] No literal user-visible strings in views/screens/navigation.
- [ ] No hardcoded colors in classnames; only theme tokens.
- [ ] New files are kebab-case.
- [ ] UI components use `cva` + `cn`.
- [ ] Hooks live in `packages/hooks`.
- [ ] API logic is in `packages/api-rest` or `packages/api-native`.
- [ ] Routes live in `apps/self-service/src/app`.

## 10) Runtime Config (Web)

- Runtime config is loaded in `apps/self-service/src/configs/runtime-config.tsx`.
- Web production reads `/config.json` at runtime; native and dev use `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars.
- Keep `apps/self-service/example.config.json` as the deploy template. Place the real
  `config.json` next to `dist/index.html` (same URL origin).
- Serve `config.json` with `no-store` or a short TTL; keep JS bundles immutable.
- Native splash screen stays up until fonts and runtime config are ready.

## 11) Data and Persistence

This repo uses TanStack Query and TanStack React DB together, but nothing is persisted unless explicitly wired.

### React DB collections

- `localOnlyCollectionOptions` collections are in-memory collections (good for local app state and as a normalized in-app cache).
- Collections do not persist to disk by default. If you need persistence, add it explicitly (for example, by writing state to storage on change and hydrating on boot).

### Query-backed collections (`queryCollectionOptions`)

- `queryCollectionOptions` wires a collection to a fetch/query function, but it still does not automatically persist to disk.
- Use `onInsert/onUpdate/onDelete` only when you intentionally want collection-driven CRUD (often for optimistic UI and/or offline queuing). For sensitive, server-authoritative resources (like API keys), prefer API-first writes unless you have a clear rollback/error strategy.

### What is persisted today

- Auth session is explicitly persisted: SecureStore on native and IndexedDB on web (`packages/hooks/src/auth/auth-storage.ts`).
- React Query cache is not currently persisted (`apps/self-service/src/queries/query-client.ts`).

### Current API keys approach

- API keys are Query-first (React Query + REST) and do not use a local collection.
- Mutations invalidate the `api-keys` query on success rather than optimistic local inserts.
